#### The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.

Explicit is better than implicit.

Simple is better than complex.

Complex is better than complicated.

Flat is better than nested.

Sparse is better than dense.

Readability counts.

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

Although practicality beats purity.

Errors should never pass silently.

Unless explicitly silenced.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

There should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it.

Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

Now is better than never.

Although never is often better than *right* now.

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

Namespaces are one honking great idea — let's do more of those!

#### Python之禅 by Tim Peters

优美胜于丑陋

明了胜于晦涩

简洁胜于复合

复合胜于复杂

扁平胜于嵌套

分散胜于密集

可读性很重要

再特殊的情况，都不要违背规则

决不放过异常，除非确定这样做

面对模棱两可，不要尝试去猜测

尽量找一种，最好是唯一一种明确的解决方法

即使这种方法起初并不明确，除非你是荷兰人

现在开始胜过永不行动

然而仓促动手不如不做

如果实现方案很难解释，那就是个坏思路

如果实现方案容易解释，可能是个好思路

命名空间是个绝妙理念，我们应多加利用
